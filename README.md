# DECODE_for_Robust_Image_Classification
Due to the demand for a large number of labeled samples,how to collect a sufficient training set seems to be a criticalissue for deep CNN model training.
One may observe that the current training strategies simply assume that there is a relatively clean dataset available for model training, which is collected by, for example, expert labeling.
This assumption holds for many elaborately constructed benchmarks,like ImageNet. 
However, in practice, collecting such a large labeled training set is expensive and burdensome.
For example, collecting labeled samples from Internet, e.g., retrieving images from image search engine like Google using target keyword, turns out to be a convenient and economical way, which has drawn attention from some works [17], [18].
It can provide nearly labor-free labeled images with potentially unlimited size.
